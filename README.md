#   How a top bank is accelerating AI in the Financial industry
## OverView and Origin
*   JP Morgan Chase
*  	JP Morgan has a long and colored history in the financial services industry. “Dating back to 1854 when Junius S. Morgan joined George Peabody in London in a financial company named Peabody, Morgan & Co. . . . in 1895 and became J.P. Morgan and Company.” (Wikipedia J.P. Morgan & Co)
*	“J.P. Morgan was incorporated in 1940,[9]. (New York Bank History, Scripophily.com 2006) For 146 years, until 2000, J.P. Morgan specialized in commercial banking, before a merger with Chase Manhattan Bank led to the business line spinning off under the Chase brand.[3][4]” (Chernow, 2010, Norris 2000)
*	JP Morgan has always been a leader in cutting edge technology so it was no wonder they would be leading the financial services in the development and implementation of AI and Machine Learning.
*	The company is self-funded and spends a significant portion of is technology budget to AI and machine learning. “For instance, their technology spend was expected to reach $17 billing in 2024” (am.jpmorgan.com)
## Business Activities
*	JP has its own AI research program to develop solutions for its customer’s and businesses. JP has a huge spectrum of areas that they are utilizing the research teams including but not limited to Data safety, client experience, fraud detection, employee empowerment and more. “JP started their journey with AI many years ago but in 2018 hired Manuela Veloso as their head of AI research and have over 400 use case.” (“Artificial Intelligence Research, jpmorgan.com)
*	JP needs to get consumer buy in for the utilization of technology and ensure it safe guards against fraud. It also needs to ensure that its technology is not susceptible to other AI programs that can hack into the systems.
*	Since JP has a large technology budget, they can spend more dollars than other financial companies given the clear advantage.
*	“Most recently they have launched an AI assistant LMM Suite utilizing OpenAI’s technology to help employees with tasks like writing emails and reports.” (CoPilot)ink Rolled out to 140,000 employees. They initially banned their employees from utilizing ChatGPT because they did not want to expose their data to their data to the outside masses. This is JP’s way of containerizing their data just for the employee use. It took about a year to create the employee portal.” (“Artificial Intelligence Research, jpmorgan.com)
## Landscape
*	The company is in the financial industry, including investment banking, commercial banking, Consumer banking and Asset & Wealth Management (jpmorganchase.com)
*	JP has utilized AI for training their employees, integration across operations for efficiency and decision making, customer service – such as chat bots or the employee uses the LLM to get answers in their own policy/procedures and in Risk Management to help identify and mitigate potential risk. (jpmorganchase.com)
*	The other major financial institutions that are gaining great strides in AI are “Capital One, Wells Fargo, Royal Bank of Canada, TD Bank, Goldman Sachs and First Citizens” (Axios)
## Results
*	JP has hundreds of publications on their AI research, they are working with universities to give AI Research awards, and finding ways to use AI in their business to enrich the lives of their customers and employees. (jpmorganchase.com)
*	Although JP leads in the AI Research, Capital One leads in AI patents and Wells Fargo in AI investments. (Axios)
## Recommendations
*	I have been in the financial services business for over 35 years and the need for AI and ML in the backroom function space is greatly needed. I understand that most financial services want to focus on the customer and not the employee but by empowering the employee they are focusing on the customer.
*	The new AI would utilize the existing core systems and automate the repetitive tasks freeing up the employee to focus on more complex tasks. It is also important to utilize technology to help train a younger set of workers. The current staff in most financial industry back officers are very seasoned and ripe for retirement. It has been a struggle for at least a decade to find employees with back-room knowledge.
*	It is very important for the banks to move forward with this new technology to stay in business as their staff ages and to keep up with the competition.
